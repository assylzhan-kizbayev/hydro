Implement a command that would make a set of benchmarks to determine
typical execution time for certain operations as well as memory usage
(e.g. sum of fields, gradient calculation)

TODO Allow modules to add their own console commands

TODO Automatic module registration

TODO Commands to draw boundary and initial conditions

TODO Function to extract scalar component from a vector field

     (e.g. change approximation or boundary conditions type)

TODO Split source files

TODO Output step001 -- with step number

TODO Stream to string converter for log and error messages

TODO Stat: estimated time
